# WASSA-2018-implicit-emotions-shared-task

The code of WASSA-2018 implicit emotions share task, LSTM, GRU, capsule network and other neural networks are used. Finally, integration is used to improve model performance.

In the data preprocessing stage, the Stanford word splitter is used for text segmentation. Keep pause words and correct or delete irregular words. 

The weka tool was used in the model to generate emotional characteristics and added them into the model.

The way of ensemble learning is soft voting.
